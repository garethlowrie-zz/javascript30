    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Gaz"; // Team is a reference to the original array. it wil update the original too

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // No params just copies the array

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log("Team 3");
    console.log(team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // ES6 spread an iterable array BEST WAY
    console.log("Team 4");
    console.log(team4);
    team4[3] = 'new text';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); // Best way
    console.log("Team 5");
    console.log(team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const car = {
      make: 'Renault',
      model: 'Clio'
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const car2 = Object.assign({}, car, {model: 'Scenic'})
    console.log("Copy of Car");
    console.log(car2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
